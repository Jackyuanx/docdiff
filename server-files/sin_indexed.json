Singapore is also projected to experience more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, which can lead to inland flooding. Since April 2020, PUB has been appointed the national coastal protection agency to address inland and coastal flooding holistically. To mitigate the impact of sea level rise, the minimum reclamation levels for new developments have been raised from 3 m to at least 4 m above the mean sea level since 2011. New critical infrastructure such as Tuas Mega Port and Changi Airport Terminal 5 will be built at least 5 m or more above the current mean sea level. PUB is progressively conducting site-specific studies across Singapore\u2019s varied coastline of more than 300 km to examine various coastal adaptation solutions. Where feasible, they will be co-located with amenities or recreational spaces for the community to enhance the living environment. PUB will also explore hybrid solutions that combine nature-based elements with hard engineering measures. Land reclamation is also a viable measure to protect our coasts, while creating more land for housing and other needs. To holistically assess the combined effects of extreme coastal sea levels and intense rainfall, PUB is also developing a Coastal-Inland Flood Model. This model will support the planning and operations of coastal adaptation measures. To enhance inland flood resilience, PUB adopts a \u201cSource-Pathway-Receptor\u201d approach, which looks at catchment-wide solutions to build in flexibility and adaptability to cope with higher intensity storms. This comprehensive approach covers the entire drainage system, addressing not just the pathway over which the stormwater travels (i.e. \u201cPathway\u201d), but also in areas generating stormwater run-off (i.e. \u201cSource\u201d) and the areas where floods may occur (i.e. \u201cReceptor\u201d). PUB raised the drainage design standards in 2011 so that our drains can handle up to 50% higher rainfall intensities (i.e. \u201cPathway\u201d). All new developments and re-developments of 0.2 hectares (ha) or more are required to implement measures to slow down surface run-off and reduce the peak flow of stormwater into the public drainage system, by implementing on-site detention measures (i.e. \u201cSource\u201d) since 2014. Developments are also required to adhere to the minimum platform and crest levels or install flood barriers to prevent floodwaters from entering buildings (i.e. \u201cReceptor\u201d). These structural measures are complemented by the use of technology such as X-band radars and an extensive network of water level sensors and CCTVs installed island-wide, to better predict and respond to floods. Public alerts can also be issued earlier, enabling residents in areas at risk of flash floods to take preventive measures such as deploying portable flood barriers."

NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient sources that can cushion Singapore against the uncertainties in water supply brought about by climate change. To promote water conservation and efficient use of water, PUB introduced a Mandatory Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MWELS) and minimum water efficiency standard in 2009 to help consumers make more informed choices and encourage suppliers to introduce more water-efficient fittings and appliances into the market. As part of the scheme, suppliers are required to display water efficiency labels on water fittings and appliances, as well as on their packaging and advertisements. PUB has also rolled out the Smart Water Meter Programme to install 300,000 smart water meters in residential and commercial/industrial premises under the first phase of the programme. With smart water meters, water consumption will be read automatically and transmitted remotely back to PUB daily, improving resource efficiency and augmenting PUB\u2019s capabilities in early leak detection within the water supply network and consumers\u2019 premises.

This is in part driven by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect \u2013 where a built-up area is warmer than its surroundings because of urbanisation. If left unaddressed, urban heat can significantly affect urban liveability and human health. Singapore\u2019s Urban Heat Island Mitigation Workgroup (UHI WG), comprising infrastructure and public health agencies, was hence formed in 2019 to coordinate WOG efforts to study and mitigate UHI effects. The UHI WG is developing capabilities to measure and model the UHI effect, through the deployment of climate sensors to collect data on the UHI effect. To further investigate the effectiveness of potential UHI mitigation strategies, the UHI WG is also coordinating research on the impact of the UHI effect and possible mitigation measures. For example, the Cooling Singapore 2.0 research project aims to create a Digital Urban Climate Twin to holistically model the UHI effect in Singapore.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, resulting in higher material costs. Parties may face challenges meeting immediate spending needs, such as regular infrastructure maintenance, while continuing to make longer-term investments to adapt to climate change. Singapore\u2019s climate resilience efforts will need to evolve with the latest science, with each iteration of the IPCC report and the accompanying National Climate Change Study. Hence, while measures are put in place to defend against the effects of climate change, Singapore must ensure our plans are adaptable and incorporate the latest climate change projections. The availability and affordability of new technologies are also crucial in supporting Singapore\u2019s climate adaptation efforts. Singapore will need to continue to invest in Research and Development (R&D), and to cater sufficient time for the technologies to mature before they can be deployed at scale and at reasonable cost. For example, CCRS has launched a US$16.7 million Climate Impact Science Research (CISR) Programme to better understand the long-term impact of climate change on Singapore. The CISR Programme will focus on five key priority areas \u2013 sea level rise; water resource and flood management; biodiversity and food security; human health and energy; and cross-cutting research to bridge science-policy translation.

Since May 2013, Singapore has imported LNG from global gas markets through our LNG terminal. Having access to both LNG and piped natural gas has helped to diversify and secure our energy sources and further increase the share of clean natural gas in our fuel mix. The proportion of Singapore\u2019s electricity generated by natural gas rose from 26% in 2001 to 95.8% in 2020. The grid emission factor of the power system has improved in tandem. Today, Singapore ranks among the countries with the highest percentage use of natural gas for electricity generation. Our fuel mix makes us much less carbon-intensive than many other nations that still use coal as an important part of their power generation. Notwithstanding this, we have launched the Genco Energy Efficiency Grant Call and Advanced Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) incentive scheme to encourage generation companies to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions of their existing natural gas units."

We have also set targets to achieve 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030. To achieve this, we are increasing solar deployment on both conventional rooftop spaces and innovative solar applications (e.g. floating solar, solar on building facades).

R&D funding was also directed towards building capabilities in solar PV manufacturing, systems, and grid integration. Moving forward, Singapore will continue to invest in R&D to develop low-cost, high-efficiency cells and modules, urban solar system capabilities, and grid integration solutions for intermittent renewables. On the demand side, the Government embarked on the SolarNova programme which aggregates demand for solar PV deployment across public sector buildings and spaces, to catalyse the growth of the solar industry in Singapore. Five leasing tenders totalling 296 MWp have been awarded since 2015, with a sixth tender awarded in 2022 for 70 MWp of solar energy. The SolarNova programme forms part of Singapore\u2019s plan to reach at least 2 GWp of installed solar PV capacity by 2030. PUB is actively deploying solar panels on reservoirs. The clean energy generated is sufficient to power PUB\u2019s five local water treatment plants and the Marina Barrage, offsetting approximately 7% of PUB\u2019s annual energy needs and reducing our carbon emissions by about 32 kilotonnes per year. Two floating solar PV systems of 1.5 MWp each were also deployed at Bedok and Lower Seletar Reservoirs in 2021.

Second, we intend to increase our overall waste recycling rate to 70% by 2030 from the current 52%. Third, we maximise energy efficiency in operations and increase energy production and recovery. One key initiative in progress is the co-location of a used water treatment plant (Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (TWRP)) and an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF), which is expected to be completed in phases from 2026 onwards. The integration of these two facilities is collectively known as the Tuas Nexus and provides an opportunity to harness synergies in treating used water and solid waste, reaping the benefits of a Water-Energy-Waste nexus. Among the many synergies at Tuas Nexus, the additional biogas produced at TWRP through the co-digestion of food waste slurry and used water sludge will be combusted at the IWMF to enhance its overall plant thermal efficiency and increase power production. The electricity generated by IWMF will be sufficient to sustain the operations of Tuas Nexus, and excess electricity will be exported to the national grid.

    "text": "Carbon Tax: The objective of this measure is to complement other mitigation actions by providing an economy-wide price signal for GHG reduction while allowing businesses flexibility. The tax came into force on 1 January 2019 at S$5/tCO\u2082 eq and will rise to S$25 in 2024\u20132025, S$45 in 2026\u20132027, and eventually S$50\u201380 by 2030. The carbon tax covers ~80% of national emissions and applies to large industrial emitters in manufacturing, power generation, water, and waste sectors. Taxable facilities must submit a Monitoring Plan and annual emissions reports verified by accredited external auditors. The nature of action is a market-based instrument. No specific 2020 MtCO\u2082 eq goal applies, as its impact is reflected across sectoral policies. Gas coverage: CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, HFCs, PFCs, SF\u2086. Progress indicator: Carbon intensity and energy efficiency improvements. Results are demonstrated through abatement from sector-specific measures, not standalone."
