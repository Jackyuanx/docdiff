(2) A request for additional information under subregulation (1) must—  (a) be made in writing; and  (b) specify a period within which the information must be given to the Authority; and  (c) advise the applicant that the time limit that applies to the processing of the application under regulation 453 has been suspended and will remain suspended—  (i) until the additional information requested is provided; or  (ii) if that information is not provided, until the end of the period specified under paragraph (b).  (3) In specifying a period under subregulation (2)(b), the Authority must not specify a period that is longer than—  (a) subject to regulation 471, in the case of a major hazard facility licence, 6 months;  (b) in the case of a high risk work licence, 45 days;  (c) in the case of any other licence, 60 days.  (4) If the Authority requests additional information from an applicant, the following periods are not to be counted for the purposes of calculating the periods specified in regulation 453(2)—  (a) the period from when the request is sent to the applicant to when the additional information is received by the Authority; or  (b) if the information is not provided, the period from when the request is sent to the applicant to the end of the period specified under subregulation (2)(b).  (5) Nothing in this regulation restricts the number of requests for additional information that the Authority may make, however, if the Authority makes more than one request it must ensure that the cumulative total of the periods specified or used (whichever is the shorter) under subregulation (2)(b) in respect of the requests does not exceed the period listed in regulation 453(2) with respect to the relevant type of licence. Example A person applies for a high risk work licence. The Authority seeks additional information and gives the applicant a notice requesting the information within 45 days. The applicant provides the information 27 days after the notice is given. If the Authority seeks further additional information under this subregulation it may specify a period of up to 18 days for the applicant to provide the second lot of information. This is because only 27 days were used of the 45 days specified for the provision of the first response, and the 27-day period actually used is shorter than the 45-day period originally specified."

(4) If a person applies to renew a licence under subregulation (2) and before the licence expires the Authority gives the person written notice that it intends to refuse to renew the licence, the licence continues to have effect, even if its expiry date passes, until the relevant period specified in regulation 489.  (5) In the case of an application to renew a major hazard facility licence, if the Authority gives the applicant written notice under regulation 488(1)(b) the licence continues to have effect, even if its expiry date passes, until the earlier of the following—  (a) the application is granted or refused;  (b) the date specified in the notice."

Note Regulation 532 enables the Authority to specify the form of applications and to specify other information and documents that must be included in or with applications.  (2) An application under subregulation (1) may also be made by a person who—  (a) either—  (i) resides in Victoria; or  (ii) does not reside in Victoria but satisfies the Authority that the person has reasonable grounds for applying for a licence renewal in Victoria; and  (b) holds an equivalent licence or certificate recognised under regulation 131.  (3) A person whose high risk work licence has expired may apply to the Authority to renew the licence—  (a) within 12 months after the day on which the licence expired; or  (b) if the applicant satisfies the Authority that exceptional circumstances exist, within any longer period that the Authority allows. Example An example of \"exceptional circumstances\" might be where the applicant has lived overseas for some years and continued to perform the high risk work for which the applicant had formerly held an appropriate high risk work licence. Notes 1 Regulation 532 enables the Authority to specify the form of applications and to specify other information and documents that must be included in or with applications. 2 It is an offence for a person to perform high risk work if the person is not licensed to perform the work in accordance with these Regulations (see section 40(4) of the Act). This includes a person who is performing high risk work after their licence has expired and not been renewed (unless regulation 138(2) applies to enable a person who has applied for a renewal on or before the licence expiry date to continue working until the renewal is granted or until 14 days after the person is given written notice that the renewal application has been refused).   (4) An application under subregulation (3) may also be made by a person who—  (a) either—  (i) resides in Victoria; or  (ii) does not reside in Victoria but satisfies the Authority that the person has reasonable grounds for applying for a licence renewal in Victoria; and  (b) held an equivalent licence or certificate recognised under regulation 131.  (5) The Authority may request the applicant to provide additional information to enable it to be satisfied as to whether exceptional circumstances under subregulation (3)(b) exist.  (6) The Authority must renew the licence if the application—   (a) includes the name and residential address of the applicant; and  (b) includes any evidence of identity required by the Authority; and  (c) includes a photograph of the applicant that is the size and in the form specified by the Authority; and  (d) contains a declaration by the applicant that the applicant has maintained competency to perform the high risk work; and  (e) is accompanied by the fee required by regulation 492(1).  (7) The Authority must, within 45 days after receiving an application that has been made in accordance with this regulation, give the applicant a written notice stating that the Authority intends to grant, or to refuse to grant, the renewal.  (8) If the Authority grants a renewal of a licence to a person who holds or held an equivalent licence or certificate recognised under regulation 131, it must notify the corresponding Authority that issued that licence or certificate.  (9) In this regulation an equivalent licence or certificate under regulation 131 expires if it ceases to have effect in any circumstance other than by being cancelled, suspended or surrendered."
