Each emirate operates under an Executive Council supervised by the Ruler\u2019s Court, in conjunction with distinct autonomous agencies possessing well-defined authorities. For example, in Abu Dhabi, the Executive Council serves as the central governing body, collaborating with the Ruler to fulfill responsibilities and exercise power. The emirate is subdivided into three regions, each managed by a dedicated municipality. Additionally, an influential National Consultative Council, comprising 60 members selected from major tribal and familial groups, operates in Abu Dhabi. In Dubai, the Dubai Executive Council (DEC) stands as the primary decision-making authority, responsible for upholding security, public utilities, and the emirate\u2019s socio-economic advancement. DEC assists in devising developmental strategies and formulating local legislation. Each emirate follows a similar framework with its Executive Council, municipalities, departments, and independent agencies. Sharjah, for instance, supplements its Executive Council with a Consultative Council and embraces decentralization by devolving some authority to local branches within the Emiri Diwan, headed by Deputy Chairmen in Kalba and Khor Fakkan."

The UAE economy has confirmed a better-than-expected performance in 2022, where overall real GDP has reached a healthy growth rate of 7.9%, due to the strong performance of both oil (9.5%) and non-oil (7.2%) GDP. The projected real GDP growth in the UAE for 2023 and 2024 is anticipated to be 3.4% and 4.0%, respectively. These growth figures for the overall real GDP can be attributed to a moderation in the expansion of the non-oil sector in 2023 and 2024, primarily due to the softening of global demand.

The importance of education in achieving sustainability goals is emphasized by the UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UNESCO\u2019s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) for 2030. Educational institutions play a pivotal role in driving sustainability for four key reasons: mobilizing society through research, teaching, and outreach, enhancing climate change understanding by providing learning opportunities on the natural environment, equipping citizens with greener career skills, and introducing sustainable practices into daily life by promoting circular economy, waste prevention, and resource efficiency. The UAE and its institutions firmly align with this perspective, as evidenced by various initiatives that promote climate action through education. These initiatives include training educators, where the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with UNICEF, is training around 2850 master trainers and 1425 principals across the nation to integrate climate education into their curricula, transforming universities into incubators through the Dubai government\u2019s University Entrepreneurship Programme (UEP) to foster students\u2019 sustainability-focused ideas, fostering industry-university collaboration as seen in Dubai\u2019s Heriot-Watt University working with the Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC), developing comprehensive climate action plans at the American University of Sharjah (AUS), and promoting nature-based solutions through Umm Al Quwain University\u2019s National Landscape initiative, which uses indigenous plants to encourage biodiversity and reduce costs."
